# ReadAble

A JavaScript library to make text on your websites quicker to read.

## Usage

- download `readable.js`
- place `readable.js` in your project adjacent to other script files
- include it in HTML via `script:src` tag

## Customization

In your stylesheet, add this style rule:

```css
span.rdbl {
    font-weight: 800;
}
```

Adjust the `font-weight` to control the first letters' level of "boldness".

**PS**: `font-weight` must be > 400, as 400 is normal text, and anything below gets thinner.

## Example

Live website: <https://readable.cybar.dev>
