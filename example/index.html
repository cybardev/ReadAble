                    <p>
                        There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to
                        have it, simply because it is pain...
                    </p>
                    ...
                    <p>
                        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
                        pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
                        account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
                        rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
                        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
                        encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
                        anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
                        it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil
                        and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
                        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
                        obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
                        a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
                        or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
                        men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
                        moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
                        trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
                        fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
                        through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple
                        and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
                        untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
                        best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in
                        certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
                        of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
                        repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds
                        in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
                        secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
                        pains.
